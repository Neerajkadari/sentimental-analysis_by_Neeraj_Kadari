🚀 NEERAJ’S PORTFOLIO – AI Sentiment Analysis Web App

This project is a real, working AI web application built to analyze customer feedback and call transcripts using a large language model. It generates a short summary and identifies the overall sentiment of the feedback in real time.

I built this as part of my portfolio to demonstrate how AI can be integrated into a clean, responsive web interface using Python and Flask, while also paying close attention to user experience, deployment, and production readiness.

🧠 What this project does

Takes a customer review or call transcript as input

Sends the text to a Groq LLM for analysis

Returns:

A concise 2–3 sentence summary

A sentiment classification (Positive / Neutral / Negative)

Displays the result instantly on the web UI

Stores each analysis in a CSV file for later use

This is not a static demo — it’s a live AI-powered application.

🎯 Why I built this

Many sentiment analysis projects stop at notebooks or scripts.
I wanted to go a step further and build something that:

Feels like a real product, not a demo

Has a proper web interface

Works smoothly on desktop and mobile 📱

Can be deployed online 🌍

Demonstrates AI + backend + UX thinking together

This project reflects how AI is actually used in production-style applications.
